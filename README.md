## Webydo Features

Webydo is packed with tools that help designers work faster and smarter—without needing to write code or rely on developers. Here's a closer look at its key features and how they can help you:

**1. Drag-and-Drop Editor**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/webydo">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zDN9ciqiUZLSH_jQUndX2IR4HwTyacXO" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Webydo’s editor works like popular design software, so if you’ve used tools like Photoshop, you’ll feel right at home. You can place text, images, shapes, videos, and other elements exactly where you want them. There’s no need to deal with HTML or CSS. Everything is visual, which gives you total creative freedom and saves hours of development time.

**2. Responsive Design Controls**

Webydo lets you build websites that look great on all screen sizes—desktop, tablet, and mobile. You don’t have to create different versions for each device. The platform automatically adapts your design, and if needed, you can fine-tune how each section appears on different screens.

**3. Built-in CMS for Clients**

One of Webydo’s standout features is its content management system (CMS). After you finish designing the site, your client can log in and edit the content—text, images, blog posts—without changing your design or layout. It’s great for handing over control without risking design damage.

**4. White Label Option**

</a>

If you're a freelancer or agency, Webydo allows you to fully brand the platform as your own. This means you can present it as your in-house website builder, using your logo and colors, while your clients never see the Webydo name. It’s perfect for building client trust and offering a professional service.

**5. Client Billing System**

You can manage client billing directly within Webydo. This includes sending invoices and processing payments through the platform. It saves time and makes it easy to manage multiple projects and clients in one place, especially for freelancers and agencies.

**6. eCommerce Integration**

If your clients need to sell products online, Webydo integrates with Ecwid to add an online store to any website. You can set up product pages, shopping carts, and payment systems without needing another platform. It’s great for small businesses looking to start selling online.

**7. SEO Tools**

Webydo includes essential SEO features so your websites can show up in search results. You can edit meta titles, descriptions, alt tags for images, and set up 301 redirects—all without needing plugins or extra tools.

**8. Social Media Integration**

You can easily add social sharing buttons, embed social media feeds, and link to your clients’ social accounts. This helps drive engagement and keeps websites connected with their social platforms.

**9. Team Collaboration**

Multiple people can work on the same project at once. Designers, copywriters, project managers, and clients can all have their own roles and permissions. This makes Webydo a great choice for teams working together on complex projects.

**10. Hosting and Security**

Webydo takes care of hosting, so you don’t need to set up servers or deal with third-party services. Every site gets cloud hosting with built-in CDN for speed, automatic backups, and free SSL for security. It’s reliable and removes the hassle of technical setup.

These features make Webydo a powerful tool for professionals who want full design control, simple client management, and a smoother website-building process.
